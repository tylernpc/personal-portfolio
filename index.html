            In 2019, I took an AP Computer Science class where I learned JavaScript with Scratch-like functionality.
            From there, I self-taught HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, took some college courses in theory, and worked for the
            State of Nebraska for a year.
            I knew I wanted to be fullstack and eventually went through Don't Panic Labs, Pathways Program
            <br><br>
            My goal is to learn as much as possible as a software engineer. Working with those that share the same goals
            and interest along the way
